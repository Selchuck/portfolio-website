          <p>
            I'm interested in I.T and everything it orbits! An aspiring
            <strong> Software Developer</strong> focusing primarily on{" "}
            <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>NodeJs</strong>,<strong> ExpressJS</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>MongoDB</strong>. And, besides "CODE", I cant think of
            anything better than being outdoors or travelling. People interest
            me, getting to know people and spending time to understand other
            cultures and their customs make me feel good. I also enjoy drinking
            scotch and anything that tastes like it, reading books and listening
            to 60's and 70's rock makes me feel alive. And, of course struming a
            guitar.

            Before my devotion to computer programming, I did years of
            professional work in the hospitality industry where Iâ€™ve picked up
            key skills including <strong>communication</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>teamwork</strong> and <strong>customer service</strong>.

            As a career changer I believe I am abnormally driven with a
            frightening big appetite, and I'm looking forward to strengthening
            my development skills in a team environment, while bringing what
            skills I have to the table. Can't wait to build exciting, elegant
            and <strong>responsive</strong> website's and applications and
            differ!
