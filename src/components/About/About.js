            <strong>Redux</strong>. I have a real passion
            for code and hope to bridge my developer-designer sides in
            the future and transform my self into a Full-Stack Developer.

            Before my devotion to writing code, I did years of
            professional work in the hospitality industry where Iâ€™ve picked up
            key skills including <strong>communication</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>teamwork</strong> and <strong>customer service</strong>.

            As a career changer I believe I am abnormally driven with a
            frightening big appetite, and I'm looking forward to strengthening
            my development skills in a team environment, while bringing what
            skills I have to the table. Can't wait to build exciting, elegant
            and <strong>responsive</strong> website's and applications!
